# Web-Deployment
Welcome to this repository! This project showcases a simple yet powerful full-stack web application that combines the elegance of an HTML frontend with the versatility of a Flask backend. 

Frontend Folder:

Inside the frontend folder lies the core of the user interfaceâ€”an index.html file that serves as the foundation of the application, nginx.conf file which enables efficient management of static assets and server behavior and a requiremnts.txt file which mentions all the dependencies to be installed.

Backend Folder: 

Contained within the backend folder is the app.py file encapsulates the backend logic, utilizing the Flask framework to build robust APIs and process requests seamlessly. Additionally, the Flask-CORS extension is leveraged to ensure smooth cross-origin communication.It also has a requiremnts.txt file which mentions all the dependencies to be installed.

Key Technologies Used:

HTML: The frontend is constructed using classic web technologies, with HTML providing structure and JavaScript adding interactivity.

Flask: The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Despite its simplicity, Flask excels in building APIs and managing backend logic.

Flask-CORS: Cross-origin resource sharing is seamlessly handled using Flask-CORS, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend without obstacles.

Nginx: Nginx, the high-performance web server, is employed to serve static frontend assets and manage HTTP requests efficiently, ensuring optimal performance.


Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the "frontend" folder and explore the index.html file to understand the structure and design of the application.

Inside the "backend" folder, install the required Python packages and start the Flask server on its default port.

Configure Nginx to serve the frontend assets and route API requests to the Flask backend.
